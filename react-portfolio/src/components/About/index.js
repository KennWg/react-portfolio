            <p className="mx-5 py-2">Hello, welcome to the portfolio I made with React.  I've filled the page with some projects I've done over the last year or so as I learned more technologies.  I graduated from the University of Toronto Mississauga with a BSc in forensic science and psychology and was working in the security systems field for a few years.  
            I decided recently that it's time for a change, and I enrolled in a bootcamp with the University of Toronto to pursue something I always had an interest in.
            </p>
            <p className="mx-5 py-2">
            Over the past while I got to learn about the basics of web development with HTML, CSS and Javascript and was able to get some experience doing some group projects with others in the bootcamp.
            Working with APIs on the back end and getting to learn about databases like SQL or NoSQL was also really interesting for me.  I hope to continue to learn more and make more projects to continue to polish my skills.  
            </p>
